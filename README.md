# My-NER-Project-
This project implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using the BERT model, powered by Hugging Face's Transformers library. The model is designed to identify and classify entities such as persons, organizations, and locations within a given text.

Features:
Preprocessing: Tokenization and formatting of input text for the BERT model.
Model Architecture: Fine-tuning BERT for sequence labeling tasks.
Training Pipeline: Efficient training setup with real-time metrics like precision and recall.
Evaluation: Evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance on test data using standard NER metrics.
Inference: Code for making predictions on new text samples.
This project demonstrates the use of advanced NLP techniques for entity recognition and showcases the power of transfer learning with BERT.

Feel free to explore the code, run the model, and contribute!
